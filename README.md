## Overview

Welcome to the Ethical Eagles Dark Pattern Detector repository! Our team from IIT Kharagpur has developed a powerful browser extension that detects and exposes dark patterns in e-commerce websites. Dark patterns are deceptive design techniques used to manipulate users, and our extension is designed to ensure a more ethical online shopping experience.

## Features

- **Countdown Tracker:** Detects and analyzes countdown timers, preventing false urgency.
- **Scarcity Detector:** Identifies scarcity claims such as "Only 8 left" or "99% claimed" to protect consumers from false scarcity.
- **Pricing Transparency:** Exposes hidden costs and recurring payment information, like "‚Çπ10.99/month after" and "after that ‚Çπ23.99 per month."
- **Fake Review Identifier:** Scrutinizes social media reviews to identify and flag potential fake or manipulated reviews.
